1. loose typing can be a huge issue because there are no safety checks. the lack of strictness allows for bad flexibilty. 
2. the asychronous nature allows many processes to run which is good for web development.
3. interpreted languages are translated at runtime while compiled languages are translated, then executed. this makes javascript helpful since code will execute up until a runtime error instead of not running at all due to a compiler error. 
4. foundations are essential to learn more complex tasks. it is more efficient in the long run, so the programmer does not make sily mistakes.
5. good debugging tools and applications of javascript. also very specific file structures.
